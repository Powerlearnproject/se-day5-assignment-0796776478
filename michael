Additional Recommendations
Add a .gitignore file: Consider adding a .gitignore file to exclude files and directories that you don’t want to track in Git. For example:

bash
Copy code
echo "node_modules/" >> .gitignore
echo "*.log" >> .gitignore
Add a LICENSE file: If you want to include a license, you can create a LICENSE file. You might choose a license depending on your project’s needs. For example:

bash
Copy code
echo "MIT License" >> LICENSE
You can find templates for various licenses on choosealicense.com.

Commit and push additional files: After creating the .gitignore and LICENSE files, make sure to add, commit, and push them as well:

bash
Copy code
git add .gitignore LICENSE
git commit -m "Add .gitignore and LICENSE"
git push
